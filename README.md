# Hi, I'm **Jakub Szymborski**!
I'm an aerospace engineer and PhD candidate.
Currently working at Polish Academy of Sciences. 
You can check out my profile @ [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jakub-szymborski-061911124/)


In this repo you can find some of the stuff I'm working on in my free time (*mostly training with Python, data analysis, data visualization and so on*). 

In the PhD section you can see part of my work which I can share. 

Feel free to reach out!
